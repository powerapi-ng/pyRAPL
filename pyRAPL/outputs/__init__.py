This module contains class that will be used by the ``measure`` decorator or the ``Measurement.export`` method to export
recorded measurement

example with the  ``measure decorator``::

    output_instance = pyRAPL.outputs.XXXOutput(...)

    @pyRAPL.measure(output=output_instance)
    def foo():
        ...

example with the ``Measurement.export`` function::

    measure = pyRAPL.Measurement('label')
    ...
    output_instance = pyRAPL.outputs.XXXOutput(...)
    measure.export(output_instance)

You can define your one output by inherit from the ``Output`` class and implements the ``add`` method.
This method will receive the measured power consumption data as a ``Result`` instance and must handle it.

For example, the ``PrintOutput.add`` method will print the ``Result`` instance.
